- bugfix in dependency.  After a matching method is found, stop
  searching for method.  Before fix, dependency continued to search
  for matches, with the effect that if there was more than one
  matching job, the oldest one was picked (instead of the latest one).

----------
- automatarunner and sequences.py changes way of calling automata-scripts
- all '.pickle' extensions removed from extras.pickle_load/save apis.
